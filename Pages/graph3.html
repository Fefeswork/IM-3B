            “Data Art or data-driven art is an artistic practice that relies on the usage of a dataset to convey emotions to the audience. Because it is based on data, the piece has a more objective truth behind its construction and does not solely come from the artist's imagination.” (Benzi 2021)
            Reflecting on data-driven artwork requires one to first understand what is meant by data-driven artwork. Looking at the above definition of data-driven art provided by Kirell Benzi, a data artist, we can understand that data-driven artwork data art relates to an artistic practice in which we translate a dataset into something that we as the audience can understand. Having read the blog and interacted with the video accompanied by it I understood data art as translating data into a visualisation through some artistic way, for example, if you want to display data through a sculpture of some sort you would use data values (height, width, colour etc.) to build the sculpture which then becomes the data art and is also accompanied by a sheet displaying the dataset to help the audience understand the data further. This means that data visualisation works hand in hand with data art and that data art should be done with artistic intent.

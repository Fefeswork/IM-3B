                For my data visualisation, I want to make a normal static bar graph representing data on games. It was also advised to start off with a bar graph because it was one of the simplest data visualisations to implement using d3.js. For my very first graph, I wasn’t sure whether to create a double bar chart or a single bar chart however I had not picked a set dataset yet. 
                Below are references 2 references of bar graphs that I would attempt to implement:

            <img src="https://www.w3schools.com/statistics/img_bargraph.svg" alt="single bar graph img.">
            <p>
                
I decided to go with the single-bar graph because I think it’s always best to start simple, this is to avoid over-scoping the task at hand and make sure that I meet the brief requirements and still use the task as a learning experience. The single bar graph also allowed me to start off with a simple data set before the project becomes more complex.

            <h4>Iteration 1:</h4>
            <p>
                For the first iteration of my data visualisation, I want to add a pie chart just for more data visualisation variety and I use the task to explore another form of data visualisation. I decided to keep the bar graph and I wanted to place the pie chart next to the bar graph just for a neater look and to avoid having a lot of open space around my graph. So, for the second iteration, my data visualisation page would look something like the image below:
            </p>
            <img src="https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/588089eddd8c8e484b24e90a/images/5ff342b0fd168b777353152f/file-fWWLlbqE3b.png" alt="pie+barprah img">
            <P>
                However, there was an issue with having both data visuals on the same page and I attempted to alleviate the issue by tweaking the code but could not, I tried giving my SVGs different id tags but both graphs were no longer visible which led to me changing my wireframe design so that each data visual has its own page. This was a tough design choice, but it was the only one that helped fix the issue that I was having, however, it did lead to more wireframe ideas that would ultimately make my webpage more breathable so that things are not clustered together on one page.
            </P>
            <h4>Iteration 2:</h4>
            <P>
                After receiving feedback from my first iteration, it was pointed out to me that the data set I used for my pie chart did not have logic behind which meant that I had to either change my entire dataset or change my data visual. I decided to change my data visual because all the data sets that I had chosen thereafter wouldn’t make sense on a pie chart. So, I decided to make all my graphs bar graphs not only because it’s easy but because it is the right design choice for my data sets and because it does keep a consistent feel for all my graphs although it may feel very boring and not very creative.

                For my interactivity I did not have an initial plan, I wasn’t sure which kind of interactivity I wanted to have for my graph. For my graph interactivity, I decide to create my own data set because I thought it would work nicely with the type of interactivity I wanted to have. Below is a graph of the interactivity I have chosen to use for my interactive graph:
            </p>
            <img src="https://www.automateexcel.com/excel/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/dynamic-chart-drop-down-list.gif" alt="animated bar graph">
            <p>
                It does not necessarily use a dropdown menu; it rather uses buttons to change the data being shown on the graph. I have chosen to use this interactive method and my own data set because with my own data set, I was able to come up with a data set that presented a lot of data that would easily be presented in the form of a bar graph that can change. The first data set was initially the rating of games I’ve played based on genre, the first button would be for high rating meaning that if the user clicked on the ‘high’ rating button it would show games that got a high rating based and the same with the ‘low’ rating button. This data was based on game reviews from the IGN webpage, I collected the data myself and compiled it in the JavaScript file because it was difficult to find a free API that collected this. 

            </p>
            <h4>Data art interactivity:</h4>

            <p>
                For my data art interaction, I wanted to implement the on-hover function to display text when the user.  The animated image shows something similar to what I wanted to do; however, I do not want the cards/images to turn around for simplicity. It is a nice idea in terms of acting as a digital game cover in which the user can pretend to look at the back of the cover and read about the game.

                <h2>Blog 5: Data Visualisation, Data Art and Representation</h2>
                <article>
                    <p>
                        Data visualisation, data art and representation are all linked and often rely on each other for them to be understood. Without referencing each other the concept of data visualisation or data art would not necessarily be fully understood. We can almost say that they work as a family in a hierarchy, first data is collected then it is used to create a data visualisation, and from the data visualisation we can now begin to explore how we can give meaning to the data visualisation with artistic intention but without losing the meaning but rather creating on. The frontman of the entire family would be representation because once we have collected the data the question now becomes how we can give meaning to this data collected.
This essay will discuss the relationships between data visualisation, data art and representation strategies that both the form of communication used with reference to the provided reading as well as additional sources as guidance to navigate the topic. I will also make use of examples to further explore and unpack the topic presented.
We begin by defining what representation means. Representation can be defined as the narration/portrayal of something or someone in a particular way. Referring to the reading by Stuart Hall on representation he defines it as” the ability to describe or imagine” (Hall 2005: 18-20). Representation is of great significance because culture is always formed through meaning and language, in this case, a language is a symbolic form or a form of representation. Furthermore, in his reading Kidd goes on to state that the construction of meaning is linked to representation. (Kidd 2015:2). When referring to language in the case of data visualisation and data art we are speaking about data/code used to produce the data visualisations, it is understood as a way of communication.
Data visualisation is understood as the representation of data in the form of a graph or an image, essentially transforming data into a visual form according to Li “(Li, 2020, p.20). We can understand data visualisation as simplifying complex data and turning it into something that is easier and much clearer to understand. In the same way, we understand data visualisation the same could be said for data art or data-driven artwork- this is “an artistic practice that relies on the usage of a data set…”.” (Benzi 2021). It is essentially representing art that is using raw data which has been collected and is translated/transformed into a visual format by using data visualisation techniques. The only difference between data art and data visualisation is that data art is done with “artistic intention”. Both these concepts have an interdependent relationship as they both explore the best ways to represent data.  We also need to keep in mind that the methods we choose to use to demonstrate the data will make findings more interesting or effective as it opens the floor for further discussion of the new findings. This is where we now start to explore data visualisation and data art strategies of representation.
The HOW ART CAN CONTRIBUTE TO ETHICAL REFLECTION ON RISKY TECHNOLOGIES reading by Sabine Roeser offers us some insight into the field of ‘Techno-art’ (a term in which she coined) which helps us further study the relationship between data visualisation and data-driven artwork. In the reading, she defines Techno-art as “art that reflects on and engages with risky technologies” (Roeser 2016: 1). From my understanding this is essentially art meets technology and they come together to form one thing. One could also refer to techno-art as computer-generated art.  Roeser then refers to nuclear artist William Verstraeten, and climate artists David Buckland and Boo Chapple as well as artists that engage with ICT and robotics as examples of people who are visual artists that engage with new technologies that provide for “new materials as well as opening a whole new array of topics to engage with.” (Roeser 2016:2)
While data visualisation practices aim to avoid anything vague, data-driven art uses data visualisation and representation strategies to invoke abstract feelings, opinions, and questions. A great example to refer to would be artist Nathalie Miebach who takes weather data from huge storms and transforms it into complex visualized sculptures made of wicker and coloured beads. One of her projects Hurricane Sandy inspired the Sandy Rides, “the numerical data in these pieces build actual amusement park rides. At the same time, they suggest another narrative of what coastal life might be like in the future living with a changing climate.” (Miebach 2012,2013,2015). Having referred to the example it is understood that the strategies that data uses tend to be represented as narratives in a way. Not to say that data visualisation does not use data narrative, we see this more with data art representation strategies. The narrative is told through this data art is more data-driven (Thudt, Walny, Gschwandtner, Dykes and Stasko 2018). We can now understand that both data visualisation and data-driven art and their relationship engage with representations strategies that are much like constructing knowledge rather than just learning. “Things don’t just mean we construct meaning, using representational systems- concepts and signs (Hall 1997:25)” (Kidd 2015:4). By saying that we are constructing the know we simply understand that the data collected we are exploring data visually and data-driven artwork strategies that would work well in representing said data which helps us compare and opens up the conversation about the data represented.
The discussion above highlights how it is not necessarily always data visualisation versus data art but rather places focus on how they both constantly present new ways of representing data in the best way possible in essence showing the connectedness. Different artworks demand various forms of data visualization and data representation and analysing them necessitates both education and information, it will not always be set in stone that only certain things will be data-driven artwork and others only data visualisation. Knowing how it influences our perception of the world around us can help you appreciate the significance of that, which solidifies how we give meaning to them.

  <h2>General Aesthetic:</h2>
        <p>
          For the general aesthetic of my website, I wanted it to feel gamey so that it tells the user what this website is and what information I will be presenting to them. I thought of things and elements that would make my website feel like a game. So, I decided to use a dynamic/animated background throughout the website just so the player feels like they are entering a game world- a game doesn’t always have a static background there is always constant motion so having animated features was something I decided to add. I also chose to make the background a location of a game stage from a fighting game. Secondly, I kept the background throughout all pages for consistency as having a solid background did ruin the aesthetic a bit because the colours were matching very well, the background colour was either too light or too dark compared to the background image.gif I used.
For the CSS cards, I wanted to add images that would speak to the headings of the card- for example, if the card title was “style guide” I would use an image that displayed wireframe designs to visually display where the card would direct the player if they clicked on the card. I also decided to use animated images/gifs for certain cards these being: ‘interactive graph’ or ‘A blog post about interactivity’. I made this design choice because it adds a nice touch to the card, and it makes the page feel unique- again also to keep the game ambience of the website.
On the homepage, I decided to a video game character because the page looked too wordy and a little plain. This was an excellent choice because the gif I chose added a unique design to the overall page. A detail I noticed was that Chun Li (the character) is controlling the reading flow by directing them to the small description that I have included.

        </p>

        <h2>Font and Colours:</h2>
        <p>
          For the colour palette, I decided to match and contrast the colours with guidance from the background image. The colour scheme consists of white, black, wheat and grey. I wanted to include some light greens that matched the background, but it was very difficult to see the colour and it often clashed with the background image, so I decided to leave that out. I think the colour scheme is good- in a way it feels calm, and the colours provide some accessibility to users that may be colour-blind. I tried to avoid bright colours and made sure to keep the “calm” feel throughout the website.
          For the Fonts, I decided to add custom fonts to my website because the default fonts did not provide the aesthetic I wanted/ had in mind for my website. This was an extremely risky design choice because by adding gamey pixel font I reduce the accessibility and readability of the text on my website. To try and combat this I took some time to find pixel fonts that were readable in both lower- and upper-case letters. The fonts weren’t consistent throughout the whole website, mainly for my blog and planning documentation, because I felt like those were the sections that I needed people to be able to read clearly as they contain important information. Another reason was to also attempt to keep the accessibility of my website, so I chose the Tahoma font because it didn’t bring down the general aesthetic of the website and the website still feels gamey.
          
        </p>
        <h2>Layout</h2>
        <p>
          For the layout of the website, I wanted the pages to feel open and breathable, although the styling didn’t go as planned, I do think that I was almost close to finding the right spacing and formatting for my website. They were a few challenges in terms of figuring out how to place my different elements but I think I did a good job overall. The layout flows nicely and nothing is clustered in one space. Deciding to have a data section and a design section really helped with the flow design for navigating the website.
